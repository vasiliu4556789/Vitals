gnome-shell-extension-vitals
====================================

Vitals is a GNOME extension for displaying your computer's temperature, voltage, fan speed, memory usage, processor load, system resources, network speed and storage stats in your GNOME Shell's menu bar. This is a one stop shop to monitor all of your vital sensors. Vitals uses asynchronous polling to provide a smooth user experience.

## Credits
Vitals was originally forked from [gnome-shell-extension-freon](https://github.com/UshakovVasilii/gnome-shell-extension-freon). I was having trouble finding an up to date, resource friendly and fully featured system monitoring tool. My biggest pet peeve was random system delays becaus of I/O blocking polls, and thus, the idea for Vitals was born!
